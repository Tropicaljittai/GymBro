## Description
  The gym is becoming more popular nowadays after the end of quarantine, looking at this a lot of people, especially beginners, have little to no knowledge about what they need to do in the gym according to their own goals, it can be either building muscle or athletic goals, or maybe just losing some weight. And another thing, as our world right now offers a lot of distractions and ease in doing a lot of things now, many people are becoming lazier by the day. A lot of these lazy and bad habits will lead to health problems, being overweight, and even death related. This is where GymBro comes in, GymBro is a website which helps guide people to reach their goals in the gym. We provide features such as workout plans, weight calculators, calorie trackers, and form analysis.

## Inspired Related Work

We as the creators of GymBro ourselves have faced similar problems in our experience when first working out at the gym, where we do not have any sort of guide and just kind of aimlessly lifting weights when starting out at the gym, resulting in slow progress, not being able to maximize our work in the gym, not knowing correct form to do certain movements, resulting in increased injuries risk, and added fatigue. We’re inspired by the fact that Indonesia has a lot of tools to help them with health, and social funding, but there isn’t much help or guidance for working out, plus the fact that the gym communities here are not that much / big at the moment. We hope that from this website project we will be able to help others overcome this problem, and make sure they are maximizing their gains in the gym.
