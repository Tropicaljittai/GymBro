        <img src="PPL.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="content"> <p>You can't go wrong with PPL, it's a traditional favorite. With push day, you'll be working on your chest, triceps, and shoulders. Your legs will also no be neglected on leg days and on pull days, your back, biceps, and optionally shoulders, will be worked on. A 1 day rest and repeat. This split is good for you who doesn't have much time in the gym or a tight week schedule.</p> </div>

        <div class="head"> Arnold Split</div>
        <img src="arnolds.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="content"> <p>The Arnold split is quite similar with the PPL split, but with the Arnold split we'll be doing chest, back, abs(optional) for the first day. And for the day after we'll dedicate a day specially for arms, so biceps, triceps, shoulders, etc. And finally, leg day with a rest day right after. This split might be more tiring than the PPL split for newcomers, but we recommend you guys to try both out for yourself and see which works best for you!</p> </div>

        <div class="head"> PPL x Arnold split</div>
        <img src="PPL.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="content"> <p>As the title suggests, the PPL x Arnold split is a combinatin of both PPL and the Arnold split, even though it's fairly new a lot of people like this split, and said to be more effective. So basically for the first 3 days we'll be doing normal PPL split with push, pull, leg or push, leg, pull. But after the rest day inbetween, we'll be doing chest, back, and legs just like the Arnold split.</p> </div>
